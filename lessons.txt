Rasterization = process by which a primitive is converted to a 2-dimensional image.
Each point of this image contains such information as color and depth.
Rasterizing a primitive therefore consists of two parts: the first is to determine
which squares of an integer grid in window coordinates are occupied by the primitives
The second is to assign a color and depth value to each squares

Drawing a triangle is a two step problem
- first find which pixels overlap the triangle
- need to define which colors should the pixels overlapping the triangle be set to, process
called shading

rasterization stage deals with first step - during rasterization phase, we also compiute
barycentric coordinates which are used in second step
