          The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to
          supporting{" "}
          <a
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://ethereum.org/"

            Ethereum

          and related technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. We do not
          control Ethereum, nor are we the only organization that funds critical
          development of Ethereum-related technologies. We are part of a large
          ecosystem of of organizations, individuals, and companies who support
          Ethereum.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to do what is best for Ethereumâ€™s long-term success.
          Our role is to allocate resources to critical projects, be a valued
          voice within the Ethereum ecosystem, and be an advocate for Ethereum
          to the outside world.
