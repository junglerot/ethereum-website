        <h1>What is the Ethereum Foundation?</h1>
        <p>
          The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization that
          supports development of the Ethereum blockchain, the growing ecosystem
          around it, and related technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. We do not
          control Ethereum, nor are we the only organization that funds critical
          development of Ethereum-related technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to do what is best for Ethereumâ€™s long-term success.
          Our role is to allocate resources to critical projects, be a valued
          voice within the Ethereum ecosystem, and be an advocate for Ethereum
          to the outside world.
        </p>
